          <strong>How we use your personal data</strong>
          <p><em>Legal basis</em></p>
          <p>The law requires us to have a legal basis for collecting and using your personal data. We rely on one
              or more of the following legal bases:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Performance of a contract with you:</strong> Where we need to perform the contract we
                  are about to enter
                  into or have entered into with you.</li>
              <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We may use your personal data where it is necessary to
                  conduct our
                  business and pursue our legitimate interests, for example to prevent fraud and enable us to give
                  you the best and most secure customer experience. We make sure we consider and balance any
                  potential impact on you and your rights (both positive and negative) before we process your
                  personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
                  where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are
                  otherwise required or permitted to by law).</li>
              <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> We may use your personal data where it is necessary for
                  compliance with a
                  legal obligation that we are subject to. We will identify the relevant legal obligation when we
                  rely on this legal basis.</li>
              <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We rely on consent only where we have obtained your active agreement
                  to use your
                  personal data for a specified purpose, for example if you subscribe to an email newsletter. You
                  have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by sending us an email asking us to
                  stop emailing or contacting you.</li>
              <li><strong>Vital interests:</strong> In situations where processing personal information is
                  necessary to protect
                  someone’s life, where consent is unable to be given and where other lawful bases are not
                  appropriate, we may process personal information on the basis of vital interests. For example,
                  we may inform relevant organisations if we have a safeguarding concern about a vulnerable
                  person.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p><em>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</em></p>
          <p>We have set out below, in a table format , a description of all the ways we plan to use the various
              categories of your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also
              identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p>

          <p>For the purposes set out in our privacy policy above we may share your personal data with the parties
              set out below:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Specific third parties such as:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Credit reference agencies: so far as it relates to clients who cancel payments to us
                          without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to
                          refund their money.</li>
                      <li>Service providers and business partners: we may share your personal data with businesses
                          that provide services to us, or with business partners. As examples: we may pass your
                          payment information to our payment service provider to take payments from you; or we may
                          use fraud prevention agencies and credit reference agencies to verify your identity and
                          we may pass your information to those agencies if we strongly suspect fraud.</li>
                      <li>Where you have given us explicit permission to do so, to selected third party associates
                          whom we consider may provide products or services you would find useful.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our
                  assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change
                  happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set
                  out in this privacy policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in
              accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data
              for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and
              in accordance with our instructions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>International transfers</strong>
          <p>We do not transfer your personal data outside the UK.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Data security</strong>
          <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
              accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we
              limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties
              who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and

          <strong>Data retention</strong>
          <p><em>How long will you use my personal data for?</em></p>
          <p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are set out in the table in
              section 4 above.</p>
          <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
              sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
              your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
              those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other
              requirements.</p>
          <p>We may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal
              obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
              interests of another natural person.</p>
          <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see section 11 below for further
              information.</p>
          <p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated
              with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information
              indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

      <li>
          <strong>Your legal rights</strong>
          <p>You have a number of rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
          <p>You have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This
                  enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
                  lawfully processing it.</li>
              <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
                  incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                  accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
              <li>Request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us to
                  delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
                  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
                  successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
                  processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
                  comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request
                  of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time
                  of your request.</li>
              <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
                  those of a third party) as the legal basis for that particular use of your data (including
                  carrying out profiling based on our legitimate interests). In some cases, we may demonstrate
                  that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your right
                  to object.</li>
              <li>You also have the absolute right to object any time to the processing of your personal data for
                  direct marketing purposes (see section 5 for details of how to object to receiving direct
                  marketing communications).</li>
              <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you,
                  or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                  machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
                  initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract
                  with you.</li>
              <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (see
                  the table in section 4 for details of when we rely on your consent as the legal basis for using
                  your data). However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before
                  you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
                  products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                  your consent.</li>
              <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend
                  the processing of your personal data in one of the following scenarios:
                  <ul>
                      <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:black"></i> If you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
                      <li> <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:black"></i> Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                      <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:black"></i> Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
                          establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                      <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:black"></i> You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
                          overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the contact details
              in section 12.</p>
          <p><em>No fee usually required</em></p>
          <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
              However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
              excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
          <p><em>What we may need from you</em></p>
          <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
              right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
              measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
              We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
              our response.</p>
          <p><em>Time limit to respond</em></p>
          <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer
              than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
              case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
